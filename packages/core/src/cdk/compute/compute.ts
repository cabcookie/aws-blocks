 * Base class for a Blocks *compute* — a runtime that executes handler code
 * (Lambda today; containers later). A compute owns the physical function/service
 * plus its ingress, and receives config via {@link setEnv}.
 *
 * The backend entry and stack name a compute needs are inherited from
 * {@link Scope} (`backendHandlerPath` / `backendStackName`), which resolve them
 * from the owning BlocksStack/BlocksBackend — never caller-supplied, so every
 * compute in an app runs the same backend and agrees on the resource-name
 * namespace.
 *
 * The abstract base lives in core (a framework primitive); concrete computes
 * live in their own packages (e.g. `LambdaCompute` in `@aws-blocks/bb-lambda-compute`).
 *
 * @internal Not exported from the package's public entry points. Customers
 * cannot instantiate a compute until the customer-facing surface exists.
